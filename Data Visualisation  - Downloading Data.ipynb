    "A data set is a collection of data that is reated to a particular subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've looked at how data can be visualised using Matplotlib and Plotly. We created simple plots with Matplotlib and used a scatter plot to explore random walks. We also created histograms with Plotly and used them to explore the results of rolling dice of different sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we're going to learn how we can download data from online sources and continue using Matplotlib and Plotly to visualise the data we download.\n",
    "We're going to download data sets from online sources and try to analyse the data and discover patterns in the data given us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll access and visualize data stored in two common data formats, CSV and JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JSON\n",
    "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is usually used for transmitting data in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you’ll be prepared to work with different types and data set formats, and also have a deeper understanding of how to build complex visualizations. Being able to access and visualize online data of different types and formats is essential to working with a wide variety of realworld data sets."
